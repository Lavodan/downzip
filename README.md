# downzip
A CLI/GUI tool for downloading and uncompressing weirdly nested archives generated by gitlab inkscape artifacts

### WARNING

Do not use this tool for non archive files, for files in a different format than it is handled for. This program cleans up after itself, which means it deletes files, no guarantee for unexpected behaviour!!  
Designed to only handle archive files in the format of archive(folder(archive(content))). Extracts content into specified folder, or the default temporary folder "./temp_down".  
Made with Windows primarily for Windows. Uses python libraries such as sys and os for file managment, therefore there are no guarantees for linux.
