### WARNING

Do not use this tool for non archive files, for files in a different format than it is handled for. This program cleans up after itself, which means it deletes files, no guarantee for unexpected behaviour!!  
Designed to only handle archive files in the format of archive(folder(archive(content))). Extracts content into specified folder, or the default temporary folder "./temp_down".  
Made with Windows primarily for Windows. Uses python libraries such as sys and os for file managment, therefore there are no guarantees for linux.

## Installation
clone repo,  
install dependancies (non-comprehensive list: python, PyQt6, libxkbcommon-x11-0, requests),  
run downzip.py or guihandler.py  
  
OR  
  
download release,  
unzip,  
run DownZip.exe  

## Usage
### as CLI
`py downzip.py <URL> [path] [-y] [-open]`
### as GUI
`py guihandler.py` OR `DownZip.exe`  
use buttons  
you MAY need to use console to confirm overriting if you do not use the "Always Yes" flag  

## TODO
- Switch to a different compiler from pythoninstaller to make cross platform installs easier (probably fbs)
- Make the GUI more readable like the light version
- add an integrated console (probably doable with threading?) instead of the default one
- reconsider the code's structure (downloader.py has lost its reason for being a separate file as it has become more simple)
